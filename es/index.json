To understand how such submarine fluid conduit and venting systems form and grow, we develop a detailed mathematical model for this reaction–advection system and we quantify the evolution of an ensemble of similar filaments. We show that this growth can be described by a superposition of advection and dispersion. We analyse analogue laboratory experiments of chemical-garden type to study the growth of a single filament undergoing a precipitation reaction with the surrounding environment. We apply these findings to geological fluid conduit and venting systems, showing that their irregular trajectories can lead to very effective spreading within the surrounding seabed, thus enhancing contact and exchanges of chemicals between the conduit and external fluids. We discuss how this methane venting leads to the formation of marine authigenic carbonate rocks, and for confirmation we analyse two field samples from the Gulf of Cadiz for composition and mineralogy of the precipitates.

In this work, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used to simulate cation ordering for the crystal structures of two BaMg(CO3)2 polymorphs: the low-temperature polymorph (up to ∼360 K), α-norsethite (R3̅c), and the high-temperature polymorph (above ∼360 K), β-norsethite (R3̅m). We found that for both structural variants of norsethite, the most stable cation arrangements are those with the alternation of barium and magnesium layers along the c-axis. Furthermore, we have adequately simulated nonstoichiometric β-norsethite structures since some synthetic norsethites were found to have an excess of magnesium, which seems to favor the crystallization of β-norsethite at room temperature.","tags":null,"title":"DFT Simulations of the Structure and Cation Order of Norsethite, BaMg(CO3)2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Julyan H.

In the Iberian Peninsula, dolomites appear in a wide number of geological formations and they can be considered as representative of dolomites crystallised in most (post)sedimentary environments on Earth. In this paper, we present a first systematic study of the cation order of dolomites formed from Neoproterozoic to late Holocene. We found that the lowest values of cation order (quantified by measuring I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios on diffractograms) mainly correspond to dolomites formed in about the last 30 Myr. In contrast, older dolomites usually reach maximum I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios. Furthermore, higher values of cation order seem to be related to higher values of the full width half maximum of 10.4 diffraction peaks (FWHM10.4). Assuming that a decrease in FWHM10.4 (i.e. an increase in the crystallite size) in sedimentary environments indicates mineral ripening, our results show that Mg-Ca ordering in dolomites might take place mainly by a dissolution-(re)crystallisation ageing process operating over large geological periods.","tags":null,"title":"Dolomite cation order in the geological record","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Enrico Gnecco","Carlos M.

We have found that carbonatation of gypsum an anhydrite occurs via a similar coupled dissolution–crystallization mechanism. However, whereas pseudomorphization of anhydrite precisely preserves the external form and dimension of the initial crystals, pseudomorphs after gypsum are less perfect and the shape and volume of the original crystals are partially lost. Furthermore, the mineralogical compositions of the pseudomorphs after anhydrite and gypsum are different, because gypsum is replaced by relatively large calcite crystals, while anhydrite pseudomorphs consist of aggregates of calcite and aragonite. Such textural and compositional differences can be clearly related to the length scale of the coupling between dissolution and crystallization at the replacement fronts. In situ atomic force microscopy observations of the early stages of carbonatation have shown that dissolution and crystallization are very tightly coupled on anhydrite rather than on gypsum surfaces. This clearly indicates that during the replacement of anhydrite and gypsum, dissolution and precipitation, respectively, are the rate-limiting steps. On the other hand, the higher supersaturation levels reached during the replacement of anhydrite lead to a competition between calcite and aragonite crystallization. This explains the fact that calcite and aragonite coexist within the replacement layers after anhydrite. Finally, we have found that dissolved magnesium in the reacting solutions is almost equally incorporated into the pseudomorphs, regardless of both the precursor phase and the mineralogical composition of the replacements. Our calculations and chemical analyses have shown that the compositions of the MgxCa1–xCO3 solid solution for which supersaturations reach maximum values correspond quite well with maximum Mg/Ca ratios in the replacement layers.\n","tags":null,"title":"Pseudomorphic Replacement of Mg–Ca Carbonates after Gypsum and Anhydrite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos M.

Some of these dolomite analogues are relatively easy to synthesise from aqueous solutions (e.g. norsethite (BaMg(CO3)2) and PbMg(CO3)2), whereas the formation of others is strongly inhibited (e.g. SrMg(CO3)2 and CdMg(CO3)2). Such a difference in the crystallisation behaviour of compounds with dolomite-like structure gives us the opportunity to investigate the reaction mechanisms which may also control dolomite crystallisation in nature. Recent investigations on the formation of dolomite-analogues at ambient conditions have revealed that: (i) when the formation of these analogues occurs, their crystallisation is always preceded by the formation of amorphous and/or crystalline precursors; (ii) such precursors can be transformed into highly ordered dolomite analogues via dissolution-crystallisation reactions; and (iii) the kinetics of the identified crystallisation-dissolution reactions are strongly dependent on both the concentration and the ratio of cations (e.g. Ba:Mg, Pb:Mg) in the aqueous solutions.

The reliability of ultrathin organic layers as active components for molecular electronic devices depends ultimately on an accurate characterization of the layer morphology and ability to withstand mechanical stresses on the nanoscale. To this end, since the molecular layers need to be electrically decoupled using thick insulating substrates, the use of AFM becomes mandatory. Here, we show how friction force microscopy (FFM) in water allows us to identify the orientation of copper(ii)phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules previously self-assembled on a dolomite (104) mineral surface in ultra-high vacuum. The molecular features observed in the friction images show that the CuPc molecules are stacked in parallel rows with no preferential orientation with respect to the dolomite lattice, while the stacking features resemble well the single CuPc crystal structure. This proves that the substrate induction is low and makes friction force microscopy in water a suitable alternative to more demanding dynamic AFM techniques in ultra-high vacuum.","tags":null,"title":"Molecular resolution friction microscopy of Cu phthalocyanine thin films on dolomite (104) in water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raúl Benages-Vilau","Teresa Calvet","Miquel Àngel Cuevas-Diarte","Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

By using sodium nitrate saturated solutions in ethanol we were able to observe the initial stages of nitratine crystallization on calcite (10.4) cleaved surfaces with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Although the oriented epitaxial growth of nitratine crystallites on calcite is independent from the solvent used (water, ethanol, or mixtures of them), the use of ethanolic solutions saturated with respect to nitratine is preferable for surface imaging in the AFM fluid cell. Additional nanotribology AFM experiments allowed us to measure shear strengths necessary to remove crystallites of nitratine from calcite (10.4) faces. On the basis of both AFM observations and measured shear strengths, the mechanism of epitaxial growth of nitratine on calcite (10.4) is discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Epitaxial Crystal Growth of Nitratine on Calcite (10.4) Cleavage Faces at the Nanoscale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed an inhomogeneous coverage of dolomite and kutnahorite surfaces by large calcite crystals. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations showed that, while calcite islands rapidly grow perpendicularly to the substrates, their lateral spreading is slower. Furthermore, the accumulated strain associated with the relatively high calcite–substrate lattice misfits (δ  2.2%) is accommodated by the generation of screw dislocations, which are evidenced by growth spirals on calcite three-dimensional islands. These observations are consistent with the Volmer–Weber epitaxial growth mode, characteristic of high overgrowth–substrate lattice misfits. Additional nanomanipulation experiments conducted with the AFM tip allowed us to remove calcite islands on both dolomite and kutnahorite (104) surfaces and to provide first estimates of shear strength.","tags":null,"title":"Epitaxial Growth of Calcite Crystals on Dolomite and Kutnahorite (104) Surfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://cpimentelguerra.github.io/es/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/es/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
