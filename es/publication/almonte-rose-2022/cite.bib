 abstract = {Rose petals may involve high water contact angles together with drop adhesion which are antagonistic wetting properties. Petal surfaces have a cuticle which is generally considered a continuous, hydrophobic lipid coating. The peculiar properties of rose petals are not fully understood and have been associated with high surface roughness at different scales. Here, the chemical and structural features of natural upper and lower petal surfaces are analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both rose petal surfaces are statistically equivalent and have very high roughness at all scales from 5 nm to 10 μm. At the nanoscale, surfaces are fractal-like with an extreme fractal dimension close to df = 2.5. A major nanoscale variability is also observed which leads to large (nanoscale) wettability changes. To model the effect of roughness and chemical variability on wetting properties, a single wetting parameter is introduced. This approach enables to explain the Rose petal effect using a conceptually simple scheme. The described fundamental mechanisms leading to high contact angles together with drop adhesion can be applied to any natural and synthetic surface. Apart from introducing a new approach for characterizing a biological surface, these results can trigger new developments on nanoscale wetting and bio-inspired functional surfaces.},
