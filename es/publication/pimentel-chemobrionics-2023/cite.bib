	abstract = {Abstract Considering the growing importance of the field of chemobrionics since the term was coined in 2015 and the increase in the number of published papers, it has become necessary to catalogue all the papers published to date. Here, we present the chemobrionics database, which lists all the chemical gardens synthesised according to their anion, cation and experimental protocol. The aim of this database is to encourage the study and dissemination of chemical gardens in order to find new experimental avenues in the field of chemobrionics. As this is such a fruitful field, the database is continuously updated.},
