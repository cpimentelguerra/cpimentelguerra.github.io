 abstract = {In this paper we present high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of dolomite (104) cleavage surfaces immersed in pure water. These images show a rectangular lattice with surface unit cell dimensions in general agreement with those derived from the dolomite bulk structure. Furthermore, the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) plots of the high resolution images exhibit a pattern of periodicities consistent with both the alternate orientation of the carbonate groups and the positions for calcium and magnesium atoms on the dolomite (104) surface. However, the Mg2+ and Ca2+ sublattices could not be resolved. Finally, the images in both the real and the Fourier space do not reveal any clear evidence of reconstruction of the dolomite (104) surfaces.},
