The two main objectives of this project are: (i) improve our understanding of the crystallization process of sulphates and carbonates at mild hydrothermal conditions, and (ii) study the mechanism, kinetics and stability of the carbonatation of sulphates. Both objectives are paramount to accomplish our foremost goal, which is to evaluate the potential of sulphate carbonatation as a ‚Äúsequestrator‚Äù of CO2. To achieve this, several state-of-the-art laboratory and synchrotron-based scattering techniques will be used to monitor in situ the mineral formation and transformation reactions. To complement the body of bulk mineralization data, during a secondment, isotopic fingerprinting will be used to determine the role of magnesium in the transformation reaction and to define if the transformation is solid state or solution mediated. The results obtained in this project will not only shed light on how CaSO4-based (waste) materials can help to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere but will also further unveil the formation mechanisms of sulphates and carbonates for relevant environmental conditions on Earth and Mars.\n","date":1634749039,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634749039,"objectID":"3334a0bed1bd16fc377aa63053cfc693","permalink":"/project/msca-project/","publishdate":"2021-10-20T16:57:19.331Z","relpermalink":"/project/msca-project/","section":"project","summary":"CARS-CO2 project financed by Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action","tags":["Crystallography","Mineralogy"],"title":"MSCA project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Crystallography","Mineralogy"],"content":"Some minerals are composed by two or more cations that can be arranged in the crystal structure in different ways, e.g. dolomite, norsethite and LDH.

In situ AFM imaging during the exposure of such modified calcite surfaces to PbCl2 aqueous solution reveals that the nanostructured calcite surface promotes the uptake of Pb. In addition, we observed the progressive smoothing of the highly reactive calcite facet terminations and the formation of Pb-bearing precipitates elongated in registry with the underlying nanopattern. By SEM-EDS analysis we quantified a remarkable 500% increase of the Pb uptake rate, up to 0.5 atomic weight % per hour, on the nanorippled calcite in comparison to its freshly cleaved (10.4) surfaces.

Some studies have investigated the effect of different foliar-applied K compounds; however, most studies have focussed on crop quality and yield parameters, or were performed with isolated leaf cuticles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rates of the foliar ion penetration and leaf surface deposition of 130 mM K sprays of compounds with markedly different point of deliquescence (POD) and efflorescence (POE) values, the rates having been previously estimated in climate chamber trials. Shoots of field-grown, commercial olive trees were sprayed with K-nitrate (KNO3), K-sulphate (K2SO4), K-chloride (KCl), K-phosphate (K3PO4), K-carbonate (K2CO3) and K-bicarbonate (KHCO3), and leaf samples were collected after 3 and 24 h. Cation and anion concentrations were determined in the leaf tissues, and in a preliminary leaf water wash for estimating surface-deposited ion concentrations. No significant leaf tissue K increments were recorded between the K sprays. Olive tissue anion concentrations showed different patterns, and a chloride (Cl‚àí) increase was detected 3 h after the foliar KCl supply. On the other hand, the foliar K applications led to leaf nitrate changes regardless of the K source supplied. High amounts of K and accompanying ions were recovered in the washing liquid of the foliar K-supplied leaves. Some foliar K treatments increased the leaf surface concentration of sulphate and chloride, suggesting a potential effect on leaf cell anion extrusion. Hence, despite no evidence of foliar K uptake, an effect of leaf anion concentrations was observed, indicating that foliar nutrient sprays may influence leaf and leaf surface anion balance.","tags":["foliar fertilization","olive","leaf","potassium"],"title":"Foliar Application of Potassium Salts to Olive, with Focus on Accompanying Anions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katarzyna Berent","Julyan H.

In this work, the crystal structures of dolomite, norsethite, and norsethite-like structures (i.e., PbMg(CO3)2, SrMg(CO3)2, and the newly proposed structure of RaMg(CO3)2) have been studied at an atomic scale by means of calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The energies of these carbonates and precursors calculated have been compared to obtain the relative energies of these double carbonates. We found that norsethite and RaMg(CO3)2 have the lowest relative energies, indicating that these phases must be relatively easy to synthesize under ambient conditions. Differently, PbMg(CO3)2, SrMg(CO3)2, and dolomite, have much higher relative energies, indicating that their synthesis is more difficult.

Atomic modeling calculations were performed at the quantum mechanical level based on Density Functional Theory and classical force fields based on empirical interatomic potentials. LDH NAP materials were prepared by ion exchange reaction from Mg2Al(OH)6Cl and Zn2Al(OH)6Cl pristine phases. The characterization of the materials confirmed NAP intercalation and also the permanence of the pristine phases in the isolated materials after ion exchange. Crystallographic lattice parameters, elemental analysis, and TGA experimental results were then employed in the calculations, which revealed that NAP anions can completely neutralize the positive charge of the LDH layers: both Mg2Al and Zn2Al LDH structures could be optimized with all Cl‚àí anions substituted by NAP. The drug assumed different dispositions in the NaNAP crystal or when intercalated into LDH. Additionally, infrared wavenumbers calculations agreed with the experimental results and showed useful to support LDH NAP bands assignment. The employed theoretical models to represent the structure of LDH NAP systems are expected to assist the interpretation of future experimental results and to be used as auxiliary tools to tune properties of LDH-drug pharmaceutical formulations.","tags":["CASTEP","Biomaterials","DFT","LDH","Quantum Espresso","Drug delivery","Physicochemical properties"],"title":"Experimental and theoretical studies on the intercalation of naproxen into the Mg2Al and Zn2Al Layered Double Hydroxides by ion exchange reaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos M.

What are the natural processes that lead to the characteristic Mg‚ÄìCa order in the dolomite structure? These important geological questions have captivated the interest of geoscientists for over a century, but the answers still remain elusive. Only recently, by the development of experimental work and the generation of large geochemical data sets, we began to suspect that both the formation and Mg‚ÄìCa ordering of dolomite could be the result of progressive dissolution‚Äì(re)crystallization reactions extended over large geological periods of time. Here, we present an initial estimate of dolomite cation-ordering times derived from previously reported data of Phanerozoic dolomites. This result provides new insight into the process of dolomite formation in nature, and it clearly suggests that can be possible to precisely determine the kinetics of the Mg‚ÄìCa ordering of natural dolomites.","tags":["Dolomite","Cation ordering"],"title":"The Dolomite Problem: A Matter of Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lisa Almonte","Carlos Pimentel","Enrique Rodr√≠guez-Ca√±as","Jos√© Abad","Victoria Fern√°ndez","Jaime Colchero"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652166448,"objectID":"05fbccfb15fff3caacd0d6d4547f839a","permalink":"/publication/almonte-rose-2022/","publishdate":"2022-05-10T07:07:27.483948Z","relpermalink":"/publication/almonte-rose-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Rose petals may involve high water contact angles together with drop adhesion which are antagonistic wetting properties. Petal surfaces have a cuticle which is generally considered a continuous, hydrophobic lipid coating. The peculiar properties of rose petals are not fully understood and have been associated with high surface roughness at different scales. Here, the chemical and structural features of natural upper and lower petal surfaces are analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both rose petal surfaces are statistically equivalent and have very high roughness at all scales from 5 nm to 10 Œºm. At the nanoscale, surfaces are fractal-like with an extreme fractal dimension close to df = 2.5. A major nanoscale variability is also observed which leads to large (nanoscale) wettability changes. To model the effect of roughness and chemical variability on wetting properties, a single wetting parameter is introduced. This approach enables to explain the Rose petal effect using a conceptually simple scheme. The described fundamental mechanisms leading to high contact angles together with drop adhesion can be applied to any natural and synthetic surface. Apart from introducing a new approach for characterizing a biological surface, these results can trigger new developments on nanoscale wetting and bio-inspired functional surfaces.","tags":["\"cuticle\"","\"fractal surface roughness\"","\"nanoscale wettability\"","\"plant surfaces\"","\"wetting parameter\"","\"AFM\""],"title":"Rose petal effect: A subtle combination of nano-scale roughness and chemical variability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel"],"categories":null,"content":"The prizes of the first \u0026ldquo;Inventa un mineral\u0026rdquo; competition will be awarded during the presentation of the Peque√±a gu√≠a de minerales inexistentes.

The cookies are from Google Analytics.\nYou do not know what cookies are? You would like to learn more details? More information below. Cookies Intro What is a cookie?\nA cookie is a small text file that a server (website) passes to a client (your computer) through your web browser (most likely Chrome). This small text file is then stored on your computer. The browser may store the cookie and send it with later requests.\nA cookie is not a program. It doesn‚Äôt perform a function. It‚Äôs just text. You can open and read cookies with a basic word processor. The two most common types of cookies are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. Before arriving to that, we first need to understand how are cookies generated, and how they are shared and with whom. How are cookies generated?\nWhen you open a website, you send an HTTP request to a server, which replies with a response. After receiving an HTTP request, a server can send one or more Set-Cookie headers with the response. The browser usually stores the cookie and sends it with requests made to the same server inside a Cookie HTTP header.\nFor example, this instructs the server sending headers to tell the client to store a pair of cookies\nHTTP/2.0 200 OK Content-Type: text/html Set-Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco Set-Cookie: tasty_cookie=strawberry\n[page content]\nWhat do cookies do?\nOnce a cookies is stored in your browser, with every subsequent request to the server, the browser sends all previously stored cookies back to the server using the Cookie header.\nGET /sample_page.html HTTP/2.0 Host: www.example.org Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco; tasty_cookie=strawberry\nThere are restrictions to which cookies get sent to which servers. More details below. Cookies Content\nA cookie has the following attributes:\nExpires\rMax-Age\rSameSite\rDomain\rPath\rHTTPOnly\rSecure\r How long are cookies stored?\nThe Expires and Max-Age attributes define the lifetime of a cookie: how long a cookie is stored in your browser.\nExpires indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie. If unspecified, the cookie becomes a session cookie. A session finishes when the client shuts down, after which the session cookie is removed.\rMax-Age indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately. If both Expires and Max-Age are set, Max-Age has precedence.\r Who are my cookes sent to?\nThe SameSite, Domain and Path attributes define the scope of a cookie: what URLs the cookies should be sent to.\nThe SameSite attribute controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.\rThe Domain attribute specifies which hosts can receive a cookie. If unspecified, the attribute defaults to the same host that set the cookie, excluding subdomains. If Domain is specified, then subdomains are always included. Therefore, specifying Domain is less restrictive than omitting it. However, it can be helpful when subdomains need to share information about a user. For example, if you set Domain=mozilla.org, cookies are available on subdomains like developer.mozilla.org.\rThe Path attribute indicates a URL path that must exist in the requested URL in order to send the Cookie header.\r Are my cookies safe?\nThe HTTPOnly and Secure attributes help protecting your cookies from malicious server and client attacks, respectively.\nSetting the HTTPOnly attribute makes sure that no client-side scripts are not allowed to access the cookie, i.e. no app or program on your machine can read your cookies. This protects cookies from Cross Site Scripting attacks that can be used to steal cookies with the help of client-side scripts.\rThe Secure attribute makes sure that the cookie will only be sent with requests made over an encrypted connection and an attacker won‚Äôt be able to steal cookies by sniffing. Sniffing can be defined as passively reading data that is being transmitted. In order to overcome this problem, we encrypt data before transmission. Encryption of data ensures that any potential attacker who sniffs traffic will not be able to steal clear text data, thus ensuring their safety.\r Cookies Purpose\nCookies are mainly used for three purposes:\nSession management\rLogins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember\rE.g. you add something to che cart (without logging in!) and when you come back the cart is not empty? That‚Äôs a session management cookie!\rPersonalization\rUser preferences, themes, and other settings\rE.g. you put a website in dark mode and when you come back is still dark? That‚Äôs a personalization cookie!\rTracking\rRecording and analyzing user behavior\rYou search for a product and on a different website you see an ad for it? That‚Äôs a tracking cookie!\r First-Party Cookies\nSession management and personalization cookies cookies are always first-party cookies. Few people have problems with first-party cookies because they‚Äôre typically used to store information that could be useful to enhance the user experience later on. Some example of information and its purpose are:\nLogins: so that you don‚Äôt have to log in every website every time you visit them\rSearches: so that you get suggesions for past searches\rSettings: so that you don‚Äôt have to change them every time\rGame scores: so that you can compare your new scores to the old ones\r Third Party Cookies\nTracking cookies are almost always third-party cookies. They collect and share user data through networks of websites, often without the user‚Äôs consent. These networks aggregate and sync countless data points. In the end, they know more about you than you expect.\nLook at it like this: You visit three websites - A, B, and C. On website A, you take some action that signals you want to buy running shoes. On website B, you do something that indicates you are a man (maybe you browse the men‚Äôs section). On website C, you see an ad for men‚Äôs running shoes, even though you haven‚Äôt given that site any information yet. You wouldn‚Äôt expect Website C to know anything about you, but the cookies saved on your computer from other websites provide it with plenty of information.\nAs cookie use became sophisticated, users became less comfortable. The first time you browse for a product on Amazon and then see an ad for it on Facebook is unsettling. It‚Äôs a clear sign that your Internet habits aren‚Äôt as anonymous as you thought. Regulation\nLegislation or regulations that cover the use of cookies include:\nThe General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union\rThe ePrivacy Directive in the EU\rThe California Consumer Privacy Act\r These regulations have global reach. They apply to any site on the World Wide Web that users from these jurisdictions access (the EU and California, with the caveat that California‚Äôs law applies only to entities with gross revenue over 25 million USD, among things). GDPR\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy Directive are the strongest examples of this. These EU laws treat cookies as ‚Äúpersonal data,‚Äù which makes them subject to regulation. Any website that serves EU residents must collect consent from users before serving any non-essential cookies to the user‚Äôs device. Others\nThe EU‚Äôs efforts to protect personal data ignited a global trend, and that‚Äôs changing the data privacy landscape.

To understand how such submarine fluid conduit and venting systems form and grow, we develop a detailed mathematical model for this reaction‚Äìadvection system and we quantify the evolution of an ensemble of similar filaments. We show that this growth can be described by a superposition of advection and dispersion. We analyse analogue laboratory experiments of chemical-garden type to study the growth of a single filament undergoing a precipitation reaction with the surrounding environment. We apply these findings to geological fluid conduit and venting systems, showing that their irregular trajectories can lead to very effective spreading within the surrounding seabed, thus enhancing contact and exchanges of chemicals between the conduit and external fluids. We discuss how this methane venting leads to the formation of marine authigenic carbonate rocks, and for confirmation we analyse two field samples from the Gulf of Cadiz for composition and mineralogy of the precipitates. We note the implications of this work for hydrate melting and methane escape from the seabed. This article is protected by copyright.

I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios in the X-ray powder diffractograms are frequently measured to quantify dolomite cation order in dolomites. However, the intensity of diffraction peaks can be affected by factors other than the Mg-Ca distribution in the dolomite structure. The most relevant among these factors are (i) deviations from the ideal dolomite stoichiometry, and (ii) the partial substitution of Mg and Ca atoms by Fe, Mn, and Zn impurities. Using the VESTA software, we have constructed crystal structures and calculated I01.5/I11.0 ratios for dolomites with Mg:Ca ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, and with Fe, Mn, and Zn contents up to 30%. Our results show that both deviations from dolomite ideal stoichiometry and the presence of impurities in its structure lead to a significant decrease in I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios, an effect which must be considered when cation orders of natural dolomites from different origins are compared.","tags":["Carbonate minerals","Cation impurities","Cation ordering","Dolomite","Intensity ratios","Carbonates","Crystallography"],"title":"The Effect of Stoichiometry, Mg-Ca Distribution, and Iron, Manganese, and Zinc Impurities on the Dolomite Order Degree: A Theoretical Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

In this work, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used to simulate cation ordering for the crystal structures of two BaMg(CO3)2 polymorphs: the low-temperature polymorph (up to ‚àº360 K), Œ±-norsethite (R3ÃÖc), and the high-temperature polymorph (above ‚àº360 K), Œ≤-norsethite (R3ÃÖm). We found that for both structural variants of norsethite, the most stable cation arrangements are those with the alternation of barium and magnesium layers along the c-axis. Furthermore, we have adequately simulated nonstoichiometric Œ≤-norsethite structures since some synthetic norsethites were found to have an excess of magnesium, which seems to favor the crystallization of Œ≤-norsethite at room temperature.","tags":["DFT","Cation ordering","Norsethite","Dolomite analogues","Computational mineralogy","Crystallography","Theoretical"],"title":"DFT Simulations of the Structure and Cation Order of Norsethite, BaMg(CO3)2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Julyan H.

In all cases, overgrowths formed by 2D-nucleation could be clearly distinguished in the lateral force images recorded by AFM. With highly supersaturated solutions, AFM imaging was hindered by the formation of 3D crystal aggregates. When saturated solutions were used, the overgrowths reproduce the topography of the substrates, indicating that the lattice of the overgrown phase undergoes a compressive strain. Furthermore, we performed a nanotribological characterization by sliding a nanotip over both the 2D-overgrowths and dolomite substrates. Thus, friction coefficients, ¬µ, could be easily quantified. As a result, a ¬µ = 0.08 on the 2D-overgrowths was measured, which is one order of magnitude lower than the value of ¬µ = 0.89 on the dolomite substrate. This friction reduction in the sliding of a nanotip on the overgrowth as compared to the friction observed on the dolomite substrate, together with the fact that atomic-scale stick-slip is observed on dolomite but not on the 2D overgrowths, point towards an anomalously weak interaction of Li2CO3 overgrowths with the AFM probe.","tags":["AFM","Dolomite","Kutnohorite","Zabuyelite","FFM","Crystal growth","Crystallography"],"title":"Formation of zabuyelite, Li2CO3, on dolomite and kutnohorite 10.4 surfaces from supersaturated and undersaturated solutions: Growth behavior and anomalous friction at the nanoscale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos M.

In the Iberian Peninsula, dolomites appear in a wide number of geological formations and they can be considered as representative of dolomites crystallised in most (post)sedimentary environments on Earth. In this paper, we present a first systematic study of the cation order of dolomites formed from Neoproterozoic to late Holocene. We found that the lowest values of cation order (quantified by measuring I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios on diffractograms) mainly correspond to dolomites formed in about the last 30 Myr. In contrast, older dolomites usually reach maximum I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios. Furthermore, higher values of cation order seem to be related to higher values of the full width half maximum of 10.4 diffraction peaks (FWHM10.4). Assuming that a decrease in FWHM10.4 (i.e. an increase in the crystallite size) in sedimentary environments indicates mineral ripening, our results show that Mg-Ca ordering in dolomites might take place mainly by a dissolution-(re)crystallisation ageing process operating over large geological periods.","tags":["Dolomite","Cation ordering","Crystallite size","Dissolution-crystallisation","Geological record","Iberian Peninsula","X-ray Powder Diffraction","Spain","Carbonates","Mineralogy"],"title":"Dolomite cation order in the geological record","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victoria Fern√°ndez","Carlos Pimentel","H√©ctor A.

Salts were analyzed by Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS) and climate chamber experiments.\n\nResults: For both Ca salts, water sorption and desorption processes followed hysteresis curves which varied with T. Salt POD was T-dependent and generally decreased with increasing T. For both Ca salts, the process of efflorescence began at or below 10% RH, at a certain level of water desorption Ca-salts becoming highly concentrated solutions (HCS).\n\nConclusions: Owing to the low point of efflorescence (POE) of both salts, drops of Ca-chloride and Ca-nitrate supplied as foliar sprays will not fully dry under normal RH and T conditions in most world areas. Both Ca salts have a similarly high foliar penetration potential despite their different POD.

This process is controlled by the interplay between the fluid supersaturation and interfacial energies present between the fluid, nucleus, and substrate. Among a number of physicochemical parameters, the surface wetting properties have been shown to be a key parameter controlling heterogeneous nucleation. The present study aims at elucidating the pathway and kinetics of CaCO3 heterogeneous nucleation on a set of phlogopite micas with and without fluorine/hydroxyl substitutions, yielding substrates with contrasting hydrophilicity. Our results show that, irrespective of surface wetting properties, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is formed during the early stages. The surface wetting properties have a strong effect on the crystallization kinetics: ACC precipitates persist longer on the hydrophilic (hydroxylated) surface than on the less hydrophilic (fluorinated) one. We show that this stabilization could have a thermodynamic origin because of the lower interfacial free energy between the hydrated amorphous precursor and the hydrophilic substrate. These results are highly relevant for biomineralization studies, where differences in wetting properties of organic moieties present in calcifying organisms could be used to accelerate or decelerate the crystallization of the initially formed amorphous precursor phase.","tags":["Calcite","Carbonates","AFM","Kinetics","Crystallography"],"title":"Surface Wetting Controls Calcium Carbonate Crystallization Kinetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Here we demonstrate the use of ethanol for similar measurements on water-soluble materials. Lattice resolved frictional stick-slip traces of a cleaved NaCl(100) surface submerged in ethanol are compared with previous obtained FFM results in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). We use the Prandtl-Tomlinson framework to estimate the amplitude of the corrugation potential and the contact stiffness. The surface potential amplitude scales with the applied normal loads are in good agreement with data obtained for NaCl measured under UHV conditions, but demonstrates deviations from the ideal periodic potential given by the Prandtl-Tomlinson model. An additional finding is that the use of ethanol allows us to explore higher load ranges without detectable evidence of surface wear. The contact stiffness does not vary significantly with the normal load up to 38 nN, while above it a sudden increase by almost one order of magnitude was observed. Comparing this to previous results suggests that considerable atom rearrangements may occur in the contact region, although the (100) surface structure is preserved by ethanol-assisted diffusion of Na and Cl ions.","tags":["crystallography","AFM","halite","FFM","surface science"],"title":"Estimation of interaction energy and contact stiffness in atomic-scale sliding on a model sodium chloride surface in ethanol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Enrico Gnecco","Carlos M.

We have found that carbonatation of gypsum an anhydrite occurs via a similar coupled dissolution‚Äìcrystallization mechanism. However, whereas pseudomorphization of anhydrite precisely preserves the external form and dimension of the initial crystals, pseudomorphs after gypsum are less perfect and the shape and volume of the original crystals are partially lost. Furthermore, the mineralogical compositions of the pseudomorphs after anhydrite and gypsum are different, because gypsum is replaced by relatively large calcite crystals, while anhydrite pseudomorphs consist of aggregates of calcite and aragonite. Such textural and compositional differences can be clearly related to the length scale of the coupling between dissolution and crystallization at the replacement fronts. In situ atomic force microscopy observations of the early stages of carbonatation have shown that dissolution and crystallization are very tightly coupled on anhydrite rather than on gypsum surfaces. This clearly indicates that during the replacement of anhydrite and gypsum, dissolution and precipitation, respectively, are the rate-limiting steps. On the other hand, the higher supersaturation levels reached during the replacement of anhydrite lead to a competition between calcite and aragonite crystallization. This explains the fact that calcite and aragonite coexist within the replacement layers after anhydrite. Finally, we have found that dissolved magnesium in the reacting solutions is almost equally incorporated into the pseudomorphs, regardless of both the precursor phase and the mineralogical composition of the replacements. Our calculations and chemical analyses have shown that the compositions of the MgxCa1‚ÄìxCO3 solid solution for which supersaturations reach maximum values correspond quite well with maximum Mg/Ca ratios in the replacement layers.\n","tags":["Carbonates","Sulphates","Gypsum","Anhydrite","Calcite","Mineralogy","Crystallography"],"title":"Pseudomorphic Replacement of Mg‚ÄìCa Carbonates after Gypsum and Anhydrite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634744348,"objectID":"664615fbca019c3c66a996655bde303c","permalink":"/publication/pimentel-synthesis-2017/","publishdate":"2021-10-20T15:39:07.595334Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pimentel-synthesis-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2, is a calcium magnesium carbonate mineral ubiquitous in the earth crust. Dolomite is the second most abundant carbonate mineral after calcite, CaCO3. Since its first description in 1791, a number of different unsuccessful methodologies has been used to tried to synthesize dolomite in the laboratory at ambient pressure and temperature. In mineralogy, this is known as the ‚Äúdolomite problem‚Äù.  This Ph.D. thesis provides a new contribution to the future resolution of the dolomite problem. The thesis comprises: (I) a study of the formation process of dolomite and dolomite analogue phases at ambient temperature and pressure and (II) a study of the reactivity of (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite (CaMn(CO3)2) surfaces in contact with supersaturated aqueous solution with respect to various monocationic carbonates (i. e. calcite [CaCO3], otavite [CdCO3], sphaerocobaltite [CoCO3] and zabuyelite [Li2CO3]).  The study of the processes leading to the formation of dolomite-like phases and dolomite analogue phases was carried out using the following methodologies: (I) mixing aqueous solutions, (II) ageing of suspended precursor phases in aqueous solutions, (III) ageing of precursor phases in solutions with acidification ‚Äì basification cycles and (IV) precipitating phases using seawater and acidification ‚Äì basification cycles in presence of additives.  By the ageing of the precipitates previously obtained by mixing aqueous solutions the synthesis of norsethite (BaMg(CO3)2) and PbMg(CO3)2 with cationic ordering was achieved in less than 10 days. Using the same method, the phases CaMg(CO3)2, BaCa(CO3)2 and CdMg(CO3)2 without cationic ordering were also synthesized. Alternatively, norsethite was synthesized by the ageing of precursor phases suspended in aqueous solutions. However, the time required in these experiments of synthesis of norsethite was longer than that in the experiments by mixing solutions. The synthesis of dolomite was not achieved by using any of the four methodologies mentioned above.  The reactivity experiments on the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces was conducted by promoting the growth of different phases (i. e. calcite, otavite, sphaerocobaltite and zabuyelite) on that surfaces. These experiments were carried out using an atomic force microscopy (AFM). A nanotribological study was also performed on the substrates and overgrowths surfaces.  The calcite, otavite, sphaerocobaltite and zabuyelite overgrowths showed a different formation behaviour. In the case of calcite, otavite and sphaerocobaltite, the growth was epitaxial. The nanotribological study of the overgrowths consisted in both the quantification of the adhesion between the overgrowth and the substrate (calcite on dolomite and on kutnohorite) and the quantification of the frictional forces between the AFM tip and the overgrowths or the substrates. The different frictional response observed in the overgrowths and the substrates allowed us to distinguish them quickly.  The main conclusions drawn from this thesis are:  (I) The formation and cationic ordering processes that lead to the crystallization of the dolomite like phases and the dolomite analogues have different kinetics, mainly depending on the ratios of cationic radii (cation2+:Mg2+): the larger the ratios, the fastest is the process.  (II) The experimental results suggest that the hydration of Mg2+ is not the main factor that inhibits the formation of dolomite at ambient temperature in the laboratory. Since norsethite and PbMg(CO3)2 were synthesized under ambient conditions, and the formation of both phases required (as for dolomite) an equal incorporation of Mg2+ and the other cations (i. e. Ba2+ and Pb2+) in their structures, we can conclude that dehydration of Mg2+ is not a significant rate-limiting factor.  (III) Different reaction pathways towards the formation of norsethite and PbMg(CO3)2 were identified. Moreover, the precursor phases of such dolomite analogue phases, as well as their evolution, were described.  (IV) The growth of monocationic carbonates on the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces is mainly controlled by the lattice misfits between the overgrowths and the substrates. Calcite, otavite and sphaerocobaltite grew epitaxially on the substrates. This was verified by the analysis of the high resolution AFM images of the overgrowth and substrate surfaces, in which the crystalline structures of the monocationic carbonate of the overgrowths resulted to be parallel to the structure of the substrates. When zabuyelite highly supersaturated solutions were used, the growth of zabuyelite on these substrates is epitaxial. However, when zabuyelite slightly supersaturated or subsaturated solutions were used, the growth mechanism could not be identified, because high resolution AFM images were not obtained on those overgrowths, due to (I) there is no zabuyelite surfaces parallel to the substrate surfaces or (II) the growing phase is an amorphous phase.  (V) On the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces, the scanning with the AFM tip affects the nucleation of the phases (i. e. calcite and zabuyelite). While the nucleation of calcite islands was inhibited by the scanning, the nucleation of zabuyalite was favored by it.  (VI) The nanotribological study of the overgrowths indicates that the different overgrowths show different frictional responses. While otavite and sphaerocobaltite have a higher friction coefficient than the substrates on which they grow, zabuyelite has a lower friction coefficient than such substrates. Through nanomanipulation experiments conducted on the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces, the minima shear strength required for detaching calcite islands from such surfaces were estimated. The shear strength between calcite and kutnohorite is larger than that between calcite and dolomite.  (VII) In summary, the processes leading to the formation of a number of dolomite analogue phases at ambient temperature were determined and monitorized. Moreover, the crystal growth of some monocationic carbonates on the surfaces of two minerals with dolomite structure were investigated. The results presented in thesis can be considered as a starting point for future works on the crystallization of dolomite and dolomite analogue phases at ambient conditions, and for investigating crystal growth phenomena on the surfaces of double carbonates.","tags":["Dolomite","Kutnohorite","Carbonates","Crystallography","Mineralogy","AFM","FFM","LFM","Dolomite analogues","Norsethite","PbMg(CO3)2","PXRD"],"title":"Synthesis and reactivity of minerals of dolomite group and analogue phases (S√≠ntesis y reactividad de minerales del grupo de la dolomita y fases an√°logas)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos M.

Some of these dolomite analogues are relatively easy to synthesise from aqueous solutions (e.g. norsethite (BaMg(CO3)2) and PbMg(CO3)2), whereas the formation of others is strongly inhibited (e.g. SrMg(CO3)2 and CdMg(CO3)2). Such a difference in the crystallisation behaviour of compounds with dolomite-like structure gives us the opportunity to investigate the reaction mechanisms which may also control dolomite crystallisation in nature. Recent investigations on the formation of dolomite-analogues at ambient conditions have revealed that: (i) when the formation of these analogues occurs, their crystallisation is always preceded by the formation of amorphous and/or crystalline precursors; (ii) such precursors can be transformed into highly ordered dolomite analogues via dissolution-crystallisation reactions; and (iii) the kinetics of the identified crystallisation-dissolution reactions are strongly dependent on both the concentration and the ratio of cations (e.g. Ba:Mg, Pb:Mg) in the aqueous solutions.

This chapter presents an overview of the recent use of LFM in liquid to investigate mineral surfaces and processes occurring on them.","tags":["Surface science","AFM","FFM","LFM","Minerals","Mineral surface"],"title":"Friction and Wear of Mineral Surfaces in Liquid Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Gnecco","Pawel Nita","Santiago Casado","Carlos Pimentel","Karine Mougin","Maria Caterina Giordano","Diego Repetto","Francesco Buatier de Mongeot"],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634744344,"objectID":"8f64db7d6bf88f25a428c96fda2194cf","permalink":"/publication/gnecco-channeling-2014/","publishdate":"2021-10-20T15:39:03.468625Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gnecco-channeling-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Gold nanospheres have been manipulated by atomic force microscopy on a rippled glass surface produced by ion beam sputtering and coated with an ultrathin (10 nm thick) graphitic layer. This substrate is characterized by irregular wavy grooves running parallel to a preferential direction. Measurements in ambient conditions show that the motion of the nanoparticles is confined to single grooves ('channels'), along which the particles move till they are trapped by local bottlenecks. At this point, the particles cross the ripple pattern in a series of consecutive jumps and continue their longitudinal motion along a different channel. Moreover, due to the asymmetric shape of the ripple profiles, the jumps occur in the direction of minimum slope, resembling a ratchet mechanism. Our results are discussed, extending a collisional model, which was recently developed for the manipulation of nanospheres on flat surfaces, to the specific geometry of this problem.\n","tags":["AFM","Surface science","FFM","nanomanipulation"],"title":"Channeling motion of gold nanospheres on a rippled glassed surface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

This is mainly due to the experimental problems posed by the synthesis of dolomite at ambient conditions, which preclude monitoring its formation in reasonable time scales. However, processes leading to the crystallization of fully-ordered dolomite-like structures can be studied by conducting experiments with mineral analogues, which are more readily precipitated. In this paper we present a study of the formation of the dolomite-analogue norsethite [BaMg(CO3)2] from a slurry which was aged at room temperature during 14 days. We found that norsethite forms by two dissolution‚Äìcrystallization reactions from an initial amorphous nano-sized precipitate. The first reaction produces a mineral assemblage composed by witherite [BaCO3], northupite [Na3Mg(CO3)2Cl] and norsethite. The second dissolution‚Äìcrystallization process leads to the almost complete depletion of witherite and northupite in favor of norsethite. While the composition of norsethite crystals rapidly reaches a Ba/Mg = 1 ratio, X-ray diffraction peaks indicate an increase in the crystallinity of those crystals during the first 48 h of reaction. Simultaneously, Ba‚ÄìMg cation ordering increases, as shown by the evolution of intensity ratios of certain superstructure and structure reflections. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the formation of fully-ordered norsethite occurs by a sequence of solvent-mediated processes which involve a number of precursors. Our study also suggests that similar processes might lead to the formation of dolomite in natural environments.","tags":["Norsethite","Dolomite analogue","Cation ordering","PXRD","Carbonates","Crystallography","Mineralogy"],"title":"The formation of the dolomite-analogue norsethite: Reaction pathway and cation ordering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pawel Nita","Carlos Pimentel","Feng Luo","Bego√±a Mili√°n-Medina","Johannes Gierschner","Carlos M.

The reliability of ultrathin organic layers as active components for molecular electronic devices depends ultimately on an accurate characterization of the layer morphology and ability to withstand mechanical stresses on the nanoscale. To this end, since the molecular layers need to be electrically decoupled using thick insulating substrates, the use of AFM becomes mandatory. Here, we show how friction force microscopy (FFM) in water allows us to identify the orientation of copper(ii)phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules previously self-assembled on a dolomite (104) mineral surface in ultra-high vacuum. The molecular features observed in the friction images show that the CuPc molecules are stacked in parallel rows with no preferential orientation with respect to the dolomite lattice, while the stacking features resemble well the single CuPc crystal structure. This proves that the substrate induction is low and makes friction force microscopy in water a suitable alternative to more demanding dynamic AFM techniques in ultra-high vacuum.","tags":["AFM","FFM","Dolomite","Carbonates","Mineral","Organic molecules","Crystallography"],"title":"Molecular resolution friction microscopy of Cu phthalocyanine thin films on dolomite (104) in water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ra√∫l Benages-Vilau","Teresa Calvet","Miquel √Ängel Cuevas-Diarte","Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

These observations are consistent with the Volmer‚ÄìWeber epitaxial growth mode, characteristic of high overgrowth‚Äìsubstrate lattice misfits.

Ridge belts and graben and groove belts can be observed at the studied area, while wrinkle ridges and large individual grooves predominate in the smooth plains. Transcurrent components of displacement are commonly observed, and transpression and transtension zones are the rule rather than the exception at most of the studied belts. Along-strike azimuth changes of deformation belts are accommodated by internal variations in the predominance of contractional, transcurrent or extensional structures. The material of the surrounding plains embays most of these deformation belts. The kinematic analysis of this complex network of tectonic structures suggests a broadly synchronous activity of contractional, transcurrent and extensional structures. The maximum horizontal shortening axis determined in this work describes a steady, semi-circular pattern centered at Alpha Regio. This deformation continued, although with subdued activity, after embayment of the deformation belts by the material of the plains.
