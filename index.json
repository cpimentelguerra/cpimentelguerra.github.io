To understand how such submarine fluid conduit and venting systems form and grow, we develop a detailed mathematical model for this reaction–advection system and we quantify the evolution of an ensemble of similar filaments. We show that this growth can be described by a superposition of advection and dispersion. We analyse analogue laboratory experiments of chemical-garden type to study the growth of a single filament undergoing a precipitation reaction with the surrounding environment. We apply these findings to geological fluid conduit and venting systems, showing that their irregular trajectories can lead to very effective spreading within the surrounding seabed, thus enhancing contact and exchanges of chemicals between the conduit and external fluids. We discuss how this methane venting leads to the formation of marine authigenic carbonate rocks, and for confirmation we analyse two field samples from the Gulf of Cadiz for composition and mineralogy of the precipitates. We note the implications of this work for hydrate melting and methane escape from the seabed. This article is protected by copyright.

I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios in the X-ray powder diffractograms are frequently measured to quantify dolomite cation order in dolomites. However, the intensity of diffraction peaks can be affected by factors other than the Mg-Ca distribution in the dolomite structure. The most relevant among these factors are (i) deviations from the ideal dolomite stoichiometry, and (ii) the partial substitution of Mg and Ca atoms by Fe, Mn, and Zn impurities. Using the VESTA software, we have constructed crystal structures and calculated I01.5/I11.0 ratios for dolomites with Mg:Ca ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, and with Fe, Mn, and Zn contents up to 30%. Our results show that both deviations from dolomite ideal stoichiometry and the presence of impurities in its structure lead to a significant decrease in I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios, an effect which must be considered when cation orders of natural dolomites from different origins are compared.","tags":["Carbonate minerals","Cation impurities","Cation ordering","Dolomite","Intensity ratios","Carbonates","Crystallography"],"title":"The Effect of Stoichiometry, Mg-Ca Distribution, and Iron, Manganese, and Zinc Impurities on the Dolomite Order Degree: A Theoretical Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

To this end, it is first necessary to study in detail the Ba–Mg cation arrangement in the crystal structure of norsethite. In this work, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used to simulate cation ordering for the crystal structures of two BaMg(CO3)2 polymorphs: the low-temperature polymorph (up to ∼360 K), α-norsethite (R3̅c), and the high-temperature polymorph (above ∼360 K), β-norsethite (R3̅m). We found that for both structural variants of norsethite, the most stable cation arrangements are those with the alternation of barium and magnesium layers along the c-axis. Furthermore, we have adequately simulated nonstoichiometric β-norsethite structures since some synthetic norsethites were found to have an excess of magnesium, which seems to favor the crystallization of β-norsethite at room temperature.","tags":["DFT","Cation ordering","Norsethite","Dolomite analogues","Computational mineralogy","Crystallography","Theoretical"],"title":"DFT Simulations of the Structure and Cation Order of Norsethite, BaMg(CO3)2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Julyan H.

In all cases, overgrowths formed by 2D-nucleation could be clearly distinguished in the lateral force images recorded by AFM. With highly supersaturated solutions, AFM imaging was hindered by the formation of 3D crystal aggregates. When saturated solutions were used, the overgrowths reproduce the topography of the substrates, indicating that the lattice of the overgrown phase undergoes a compressive strain. Furthermore, we performed a nanotribological characterization by sliding a nanotip over both the 2D-overgrowths and dolomite substrates. Thus, friction coefficients, µ, could be easily quantified. As a result, a µ = 0.08 on the 2D-overgrowths was measured, which is one order of magnitude lower than the value of µ = 0.89 on the dolomite substrate. This friction reduction in the sliding of a nanotip on the overgrowth as compared to the friction observed on the dolomite substrate, together with the fact that atomic-scale stick-slip is observed on dolomite but not on the 2D overgrowths, point towards an anomalously weak interaction of Li2CO3 overgrowths with the AFM probe.","tags":["AFM","Dolomite","Kutnohorite","Zabuyelite","FFM","Crystal growth","Crystallography"],"title":"Formation of zabuyelite, Li2CO3, on dolomite and kutnohorite 10.4 surfaces from supersaturated and undersaturated solutions: Growth behavior and anomalous friction at the nanoscale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos M.

In the Iberian Peninsula, dolomites appear in a wide number of geological formations and they can be considered as representative of dolomites crystallised in most (post)sedimentary environments on Earth. In this paper, we present a first systematic study of the cation order of dolomites formed from Neoproterozoic to late Holocene. We found that the lowest values of cation order (quantified by measuring I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios on diffractograms) mainly correspond to dolomites formed in about the last 30 Myr. In contrast, older dolomites usually reach maximum I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios. Furthermore, higher values of cation order seem to be related to higher values of the full width half maximum of 10.4 diffraction peaks (FWHM10.4). Assuming that a decrease in FWHM10.4 (i.e. an increase in the crystallite size) in sedimentary environments indicates mineral ripening, our results show that Mg-Ca ordering in dolomites might take place mainly by a dissolution-(re)crystallisation ageing process operating over large geological periods.","tags":["Dolomite","Cation ordering","Crystallite size","Dissolution-crystallisation","Geological record","Iberian Peninsula","X-ray Powder Diffraction","Spain","Carbonates","Mineralogy"],"title":"Dolomite cation order in the geological record","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victoria Fernández","Carlos Pimentel","Héctor A.

Salts were analyzed by Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS) and climate chamber experiments.\n\nResults: For both Ca salts, water sorption and desorption processes followed hysteresis curves which varied with T. Salt POD was T-dependent and generally decreased with increasing T. For both Ca salts, the process of efflorescence began at or below 10% RH, at a certain level of water desorption Ca-salts becoming highly concentrated solutions (HCS).\n\nConclusions: Owing to the low point of efflorescence (POE) of both salts, drops of Ca-chloride and Ca-nitrate supplied as foliar sprays will not fully dry under normal RH and T conditions in most world areas. Both Ca salts have a similarly high foliar penetration potential despite their different POD. The significance of the results for the potential absorption of foliar fertilizers and salts by the foliage is discussed under an agronomic and eco-physiological viewpoint.\n","tags":["Calcium salts","Point of efflorescence","Point of deliquescence","Foliar fertilization"],"title":"Salt hydration and drop drying of two model calcium salts: Implications for foliar nutrient absorption and deposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayumi Koishi","Alejandro Fernandez-Martinez","Alexander E.

This process is controlled by the interplay between the fluid supersaturation and interfacial energies present between the fluid, nucleus, and substrate. Among a number of physicochemical parameters, the surface wetting properties have been shown to be a key parameter controlling heterogeneous nucleation. The present study aims at elucidating the pathway and kinetics of CaCO3 heterogeneous nucleation on a set of phlogopite micas with and without fluorine/hydroxyl substitutions, yielding substrates with contrasting hydrophilicity. Our results show that, irrespective of surface wetting properties, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is formed during the early stages. The surface wetting properties have a strong effect on the crystallization kinetics: ACC precipitates persist longer on the hydrophilic (hydroxylated) surface than on the less hydrophilic (fluorinated) one. We show that this stabilization could have a thermodynamic origin because of the lower interfacial free energy between the hydrated amorphous precursor and the hydrophilic substrate. These results are highly relevant for biomineralization studies, where differences in wetting properties of organic moieties present in calcifying organisms could be used to accelerate or decelerate the crystallization of the initially formed amorphous precursor phase.","tags":["Calcite","Carbonates","AFM","Kinetics","Crystallography"],"title":"Surface Wetting Controls Calcium Carbonate Crystallization Kinetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Here we demonstrate the use of ethanol for similar measurements on water-soluble materials. Lattice resolved frictional stick-slip traces of a cleaved NaCl(100) surface submerged in ethanol are compared with previous obtained FFM results in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). We use the Prandtl-Tomlinson framework to estimate the amplitude of the corrugation potential and the contact stiffness. The surface potential amplitude scales with the applied normal loads are in good agreement with data obtained for NaCl measured under UHV conditions, but demonstrates deviations from the ideal periodic potential given by the Prandtl-Tomlinson model. An additional finding is that the use of ethanol allows us to explore higher load ranges without detectable evidence of surface wear. The contact stiffness does not vary significantly with the normal load up to 38 nN, while above it a sudden increase by almost one order of magnitude was observed. Comparing this to previous results suggests that considerable atom rearrangements may occur in the contact region, although the (100) surface structure is preserved by ethanol-assisted diffusion of Na and Cl ions.","tags":["crystallography","AFM","halite","FFM","surface science"],"title":"Estimation of interaction energy and contact stiffness in atomic-scale sliding on a model sodium chloride surface in ethanol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Enrico Gnecco","Carlos M.

We have found that carbonatation of gypsum an anhydrite occurs via a similar coupled dissolution–crystallization mechanism. However, whereas pseudomorphization of anhydrite precisely preserves the external form and dimension of the initial crystals, pseudomorphs after gypsum are less perfect and the shape and volume of the original crystals are partially lost. Furthermore, the mineralogical compositions of the pseudomorphs after anhydrite and gypsum are different, because gypsum is replaced by relatively large calcite crystals, while anhydrite pseudomorphs consist of aggregates of calcite and aragonite. Such textural and compositional differences can be clearly related to the length scale of the coupling between dissolution and crystallization at the replacement fronts. In situ atomic force microscopy observations of the early stages of carbonatation have shown that dissolution and crystallization are very tightly coupled on anhydrite rather than on gypsum surfaces. This clearly indicates that during the replacement of anhydrite and gypsum, dissolution and precipitation, respectively, are the rate-limiting steps. On the other hand, the higher supersaturation levels reached during the replacement of anhydrite lead to a competition between calcite and aragonite crystallization. This explains the fact that calcite and aragonite coexist within the replacement layers after anhydrite. Finally, we have found that dissolved magnesium in the reacting solutions is almost equally incorporated into the pseudomorphs, regardless of both the precursor phase and the mineralogical composition of the replacements. Our calculations and chemical analyses have shown that the compositions of the MgxCa1–xCO3 solid solution for which supersaturations reach maximum values correspond quite well with maximum Mg/Ca ratios in the replacement layers.\n","tags":["Carbonates","Sulphates","Gypsum","Anhydrite","Calcite","Mineralogy","Crystallography"],"title":"Pseudomorphic Replacement of Mg–Ca Carbonates after Gypsum and Anhydrite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634744348,"objectID":"664615fbca019c3c66a996655bde303c","permalink":"/publication/pimentel-synthesis-2017/","publishdate":"2021-10-20T15:39:07.595334Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pimentel-synthesis-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2, is a calcium magnesium carbonate mineral ubiquitous in the earth crust. Dolomite is the second most abundant carbonate mineral after calcite, CaCO3. Since its first description in 1791, a number of different unsuccessful methodologies has been used to tried to synthesize dolomite in the laboratory at ambient pressure and temperature. In mineralogy, this is known as the “dolomite problem”.  This Ph.D. thesis provides a new contribution to the future resolution of the dolomite problem. The thesis comprises: (I) a study of the formation process of dolomite and dolomite analogue phases at ambient temperature and pressure and (II) a study of the reactivity of (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite (CaMn(CO3)2) surfaces in contact with supersaturated aqueous solution with respect to various monocationic carbonates (i. e. calcite [CaCO3], otavite [CdCO3], sphaerocobaltite [CoCO3] and zabuyelite [Li2CO3]).  The study of the processes leading to the formation of dolomite-like phases and dolomite analogue phases was carried out using the following methodologies: (I) mixing aqueous solutions, (II) ageing of suspended precursor phases in aqueous solutions, (III) ageing of precursor phases in solutions with acidification – basification cycles and (IV) precipitating phases using seawater and acidification – basification cycles in presence of additives.  By the ageing of the precipitates previously obtained by mixing aqueous solutions the synthesis of norsethite (BaMg(CO3)2) and PbMg(CO3)2 with cationic ordering was achieved in less than 10 days. Using the same method, the phases CaMg(CO3)2, BaCa(CO3)2 and CdMg(CO3)2 without cationic ordering were also synthesized. Alternatively, norsethite was synthesized by the ageing of precursor phases suspended in aqueous solutions. However, the time required in these experiments of synthesis of norsethite was longer than that in the experiments by mixing solutions. The synthesis of dolomite was not achieved by using any of the four methodologies mentioned above.  The reactivity experiments on the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces was conducted by promoting the growth of different phases (i. e. calcite, otavite, sphaerocobaltite and zabuyelite) on that surfaces. These experiments were carried out using an atomic force microscopy (AFM). A nanotribological study was also performed on the substrates and overgrowths surfaces.  The calcite, otavite, sphaerocobaltite and zabuyelite overgrowths showed a different formation behaviour. In the case of calcite, otavite and sphaerocobaltite, the growth was epitaxial. The nanotribological study of the overgrowths consisted in both the quantification of the adhesion between the overgrowth and the substrate (calcite on dolomite and on kutnohorite) and the quantification of the frictional forces between the AFM tip and the overgrowths or the substrates. The different frictional response observed in the overgrowths and the substrates allowed us to distinguish them quickly.  The main conclusions drawn from this thesis are:  (I) The formation and cationic ordering processes that lead to the crystallization of the dolomite like phases and the dolomite analogues have different kinetics, mainly depending on the ratios of cationic radii (cation2+:Mg2+): the larger the ratios, the fastest is the process.  (II) The experimental results suggest that the hydration of Mg2+ is not the main factor that inhibits the formation of dolomite at ambient temperature in the laboratory. Since norsethite and PbMg(CO3)2 were synthesized under ambient conditions, and the formation of both phases required (as for dolomite) an equal incorporation of Mg2+ and the other cations (i. e. Ba2+ and Pb2+) in their structures, we can conclude that dehydration of Mg2+ is not a significant rate-limiting factor.  (III) Different reaction pathways towards the formation of norsethite and PbMg(CO3)2 were identified. Moreover, the precursor phases of such dolomite analogue phases, as well as their evolution, were described.  (IV) The growth of monocationic carbonates on the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces is mainly controlled by the lattice misfits between the overgrowths and the substrates. Calcite, otavite and sphaerocobaltite grew epitaxially on the substrates. This was verified by the analysis of the high resolution AFM images of the overgrowth and substrate surfaces, in which the crystalline structures of the monocationic carbonate of the overgrowths resulted to be parallel to the structure of the substrates. When zabuyelite highly supersaturated solutions were used, the growth of zabuyelite on these substrates is epitaxial. However, when zabuyelite slightly supersaturated or subsaturated solutions were used, the growth mechanism could not be identified, because high resolution AFM images were not obtained on those overgrowths, due to (I) there is no zabuyelite surfaces parallel to the substrate surfaces or (II) the growing phase is an amorphous phase.  (V) On the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces, the scanning with the AFM tip affects the nucleation of the phases (i. e. calcite and zabuyelite). While the nucleation of calcite islands was inhibited by the scanning, the nucleation of zabuyalite was favored by it.  (VI) The nanotribological study of the overgrowths indicates that the different overgrowths show different frictional responses. While otavite and sphaerocobaltite have a higher friction coefficient than the substrates on which they grow, zabuyelite has a lower friction coefficient than such substrates. Through nanomanipulation experiments conducted on the (10.4) dolomite and kutnohorite surfaces, the minima shear strength required for detaching calcite islands from such surfaces were estimated. The shear strength between calcite and kutnohorite is larger than that between calcite and dolomite.  (VII) In summary, the processes leading to the formation of a number of dolomite analogue phases at ambient temperature were determined and monitorized. Moreover, the crystal growth of some monocationic carbonates on the surfaces of two minerals with dolomite structure were investigated. The results presented in thesis can be considered as a starting point for future works on the crystallization of dolomite and dolomite analogue phases at ambient conditions, and for investigating crystal growth phenomena on the surfaces of double carbonates.","tags":["Dolomite","Kutnohorite","Carbonates","Crystallography","Mineralogy","AFM","FFM","LFM","Dolomite analogues","Norsethite","PbMg(CO3)2","PXRD"],"title":"Synthesis and reactivity of minerals of dolomite group and analogue phases (Síntesis y reactividad de minerales del grupo de la dolomita y fases análogas)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos M.

Such a difference in the crystallisation behaviour of compounds with dolomite-like structure gives us the opportunity to investigate the reaction mechanisms which may also control dolomite crystallisation in nature. Recent investigations on the formation of dolomite-analogues at ambient conditions have revealed that: (i) when the formation of these analogues occurs, their crystallisation is always preceded by the formation of amorphous and/or crystalline precursors; (ii) such precursors can be transformed into highly ordered dolomite analogues via dissolution-crystallisation reactions; and (iii) the kinetics of the identified crystallisation-dissolution reactions are strongly dependent on both the concentration and the ratio of cations (e.g. Ba:Mg, Pb:Mg) in the aqueous solutions.

This chapter presents an overview of the recent use of LFM in liquid to investigate mineral surfaces and processes occurring on them.","tags":["Surface science","AFM","FFM","LFM","Minerals","Mineral surface"],"title":"Friction and Wear of Mineral Surfaces in Liquid Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Gnecco","Pawel Nita","Santiago Casado","Carlos Pimentel","Karine Mougin","Maria Caterina Giordano","Diego Repetto","Francesco Buatier de Mongeot"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634744344,"objectID":"8f64db7d6bf88f25a428c96fda2194cf","permalink":"/publication/gnecco-channeling-2014/","publishdate":"2021-10-20T15:39:03.468625Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gnecco-channeling-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Gold nanospheres have been manipulated by atomic force microscopy on a rippled glass surface produced by ion beam sputtering and coated with an ultrathin (10 nm thick) graphitic layer. This substrate is characterized by irregular wavy grooves running parallel to a preferential direction. Measurements in ambient conditions show that the motion of the nanoparticles is confined to single grooves ('channels'), along which the particles move till they are trapped by local bottlenecks. At this point, the particles cross the ripple pattern in a series of consecutive jumps and continue their longitudinal motion along a different channel. Moreover, due to the asymmetric shape of the ripple profiles, the jumps occur in the direction of minimum slope, resembling a ratchet mechanism. Our results are discussed, extending a collisional model, which was recently developed for the manipulation of nanospheres on flat surfaces, to the specific geometry of this problem.\n","tags":["AFM","Surface science","FFM","nanomanipulation"],"title":"Channeling motion of gold nanospheres on a rippled glassed surface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

This is mainly due to the experimental problems posed by the synthesis of dolomite at ambient conditions, which preclude monitoring its formation in reasonable time scales. However, processes leading to the crystallization of fully-ordered dolomite-like structures can be studied by conducting experiments with mineral analogues, which are more readily precipitated. In this paper we present a study of the formation of the dolomite-analogue norsethite [BaMg(CO3)2] from a slurry which was aged at room temperature during 14 days. We found that norsethite forms by two dissolution–crystallization reactions from an initial amorphous nano-sized precipitate. The first reaction produces a mineral assemblage composed by witherite [BaCO3], northupite [Na3Mg(CO3)2Cl] and norsethite. The second dissolution–crystallization process leads to the almost complete depletion of witherite and northupite in favor of norsethite. While the composition of norsethite crystals rapidly reaches a Ba/Mg = 1 ratio, X-ray diffraction peaks indicate an increase in the crystallinity of those crystals during the first 48 h of reaction. Simultaneously, Ba–Mg cation ordering increases, as shown by the evolution of intensity ratios of certain superstructure and structure reflections. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the formation of fully-ordered norsethite occurs by a sequence of solvent-mediated processes which involve a number of precursors. Our study also suggests that similar processes might lead to the formation of dolomite in natural environments.","tags":["Norsethite","Dolomite analogue","Cation ordering","PXRD","Carbonates","Crystallography","Mineralogy"],"title":"The formation of the dolomite-analogue norsethite: Reaction pathway and cation ordering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pawel Nita","Carlos Pimentel","Feng Luo","Begoña Milián-Medina","Johannes Gierschner","Carlos M.

The reliability of ultrathin organic layers as active components for molecular electronic devices depends ultimately on an accurate characterization of the layer morphology and ability to withstand mechanical stresses on the nanoscale. To this end, since the molecular layers need to be electrically decoupled using thick insulating substrates, the use of AFM becomes mandatory. Here, we show how friction force microscopy (FFM) in water allows us to identify the orientation of copper(ii)phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules previously self-assembled on a dolomite (104) mineral surface in ultra-high vacuum. The molecular features observed in the friction images show that the CuPc molecules are stacked in parallel rows with no preferential orientation with respect to the dolomite lattice, while the stacking features resemble well the single CuPc crystal structure. This proves that the substrate induction is low and makes friction force microscopy in water a suitable alternative to more demanding dynamic AFM techniques in ultra-high vacuum.","tags":["AFM","FFM","Dolomite","Carbonates","Mineral","Organic molecules","Crystallography"],"title":"Molecular resolution friction microscopy of Cu phthalocyanine thin films on dolomite (104) in water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raúl Benages-Vilau","Teresa Calvet","Miquel Àngel Cuevas-Diarte","Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

By using sodium nitrate saturated solutions in ethanol we were able to observe the initial stages of nitratine crystallization on calcite (10.4) cleaved surfaces with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Although the oriented epitaxial growth of nitratine crystallites on calcite is independent from the solvent used (water, ethanol, or mixtures of them), the use of ethanolic solutions saturated with respect to nitratine is preferable for surface imaging in the AFM fluid cell. Additional nanotribology AFM experiments allowed us to measure shear strengths necessary to remove crystallites of nitratine from calcite (10.4) faces. On the basis of both AFM observations and measured shear strengths, the mechanism of epitaxial growth of nitratine on calcite (10.4) is discussed.","tags":["AFM","Calcite","Surface science","Crystal growth","Nitratine","Crystallography","Mineralogy","Carbonates"],"title":"Epitaxial Crystal Growth of Nitratine on Calcite (10.4) Cleavage Faces at the Nanoscale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed an inhomogeneous coverage of dolomite and kutnahorite surfaces by large calcite crystals. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations showed that, while calcite islands rapidly grow perpendicularly to the substrates, their lateral spreading is slower. Furthermore, the accumulated strain associated with the relatively high calcite–substrate lattice misfits (δ  2.2%) is accommodated by the generation of screw dislocations, which are evidenced by growth spirals on calcite three-dimensional islands. These observations are consistent with the Volmer–Weber epitaxial growth mode, characteristic of high overgrowth–substrate lattice misfits. Additional nanomanipulation experiments conducted with the AFM tip allowed us to remove calcite islands on both dolomite and kutnahorite (104) surfaces and to provide first estimates of shear strength.","tags":["Dolomite","Calcite","Kutnohorite","Crystal growth","Carbonates","Minerals","Mineralogy","Crystallography","Surface science"],"title":"Epitaxial Growth of Calcite Crystals on Dolomite and Kutnahorite (104) Surfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Fernández","Francisco Anguita","Javier Ruiz","Ignacio Romeo","Álvaro I.

Ridge belts and graben and groove belts can be observed at the studied area, while wrinkle ridges and large individual grooves predominate in the smooth plains. Transcurrent components of displacement are commonly observed, and transpression and transtension zones are the rule rather than the exception at most of the studied belts. Along-strike azimuth changes of deformation belts are accommodated by internal variations in the predominance of contractional, transcurrent or extensional structures. The material of the surrounding plains embays most of these deformation belts. The kinematic analysis of this complex network of tectonic structures suggests a broadly synchronous activity of contractional, transcurrent and extensional structures. The maximum horizontal shortening axis determined in this work describes a steady, semi-circular pattern centered at Alpha Regio. This deformation continued, although with subdued activity, after embayment of the deformation belts by the material of the plains. Future study of the tectonic evolution of the lowland plains should take into account the importance of the coeval history of neighboring uplands and lowlands.","tags":["Venus","Geology","Tectonics"],"title":"Structural evolution of Lavinia Planitia, Venus: Implications for the tectonics of the lowland plains","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
